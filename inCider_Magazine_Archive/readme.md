This is an archive of the various coding projects from inCider Magazine, and Apple-focused magazine from the 1980's and 1990's. It contains a repository of old AppleSoft BASIC, Pascal, and even some assembly that comprised various projects published in those magazines.
An archive of nearly the entire magazine's run can be found on the Internet Archive ( https://archive.org/details/incidermagazine?tab=collection ). I have downloaded all available issues and am slowly working through transcribing the code and associated description articles into a plain text format easily readable by most computers.
Even though I have taken effort to validate the OCR'd text against the scans of the magazines, it is highly likely that there are typos in either the code or the description articles. Please be aware of that if you decide to download the projects for your own use. There may even be errors in the code that were in the original publication.
Please be aware of that if you download any of these. I encourage you to submit edits and revisions to any of the files contained within. External contributions are also welcome.
