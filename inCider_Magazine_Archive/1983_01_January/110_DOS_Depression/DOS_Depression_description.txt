DOS Depression

A simple method of avoiding a particularly frustrating DOS error is our first offering for inCider's Hints 'n' Techniques department

by David W. Dilks

While working on a several-hundred-line program on my Apple II, I began receiving inexplicable DOS errors: FILE NOT FOUND when opening a new file for output and APPEND commands writing over existing data at the beginning of files.

To locate the cause of this annoying problem, I began deleting one program line at a time until all that remained was the program shown in the program listing.

Try typing in and running this program yourself. If the file named Data doesn't exist on the disk, this program will terminate with a FILE NOT FOUND error. However, when line 30 is deleted, the program runs smoothly. Another way to solve the problem is to insert a dummy Print statement between lines 30 and 40.

Moral: To avoid Apple DOS problems, locate at least one Print statement between each Get command and any disk operation.
