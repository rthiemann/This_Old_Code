This is the source code from Elon R. Musk's video game, Blastar, for the vintage SpectraVideo console.

It was originally published in "PC and Office Technology" magazine, December 1984.

Code was hand-typed from a scan of the original source code, here:

The license is unknown, but is presumed to be open to the public, given it was openly published with the expectation that people would type it in and run it on their own personal computers.

**The original scan is not of very high quality. Therefore, there are likely typos. As of Oct 25,2021, I have not yet put it into a Spectra Vision emulator to see if it runs. That is a task for a future date or another person. **

Orignal description:

Blastar

by Elon Musk

In this game you have to destroy an alien space freighter, which is carrying deadly Hydrogen Bombs and Status Beam Machines.
This game makes good use of sprites and animation, and in this sense makes the listing worth reading.
